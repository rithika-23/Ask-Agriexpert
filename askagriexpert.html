                    <li>Cottonseed meal is slightly acidic, typically containing a nitrogen-to-phosphorous-to-potassium (NPK) of 7-3-2. The nutrients in it are readily available to plants in warm soils, without the risk of nitrogen burn that is commonly associated with chemical fertilizers.</li>

                        <li>Clean cultivation : Clean cultivation means the removal of weeds, plant residues, and other materials from the fields and growing only healthy crops.</li>
                        <li>Ploughing in Relation to Insect Control:

                            The plough if used at right time is a good tool for combating many insect pests; it disturbs or kills them, eradicates weeds upon which they might feed and breed, exposes them to natural enemies or to weather control and buries them so deeply that few adults can emerge. </li>
                        <li>Crop rotation : The changing of crops in a sequence decreases the population level of pests by <br> (1) interrupting pest life cycles, <br>(2) interrupting pest habitat.</li>

                            The scheme was introduced in 2015 and aimed at providing farmers with health cards for soil. The farmers under this scheme could upload the soil quality and nutrients.

                            This information could be used by them for improving the soil condition for better quality crop fertility. Under this scheme government had collected soil samples from 253 lakh farm locations. Till date over 76 percent health cards have already been distributed by the authorities.

                            <p >
                                Crop rotation is the practice of planting different crops sequentially on the same plot of land to improve soil health, optimize nutrients in the soil, and combat pest and weed pressure.
                                Say a farmer has planted a field of corn. When the corn harvest is finished, he might plant beans, since corn consumes a lot of nitrogen and beans return nitrogen to the soil.
                                If a farmer plants the exact same crop in the same place every year,she continually draws the same nutrients out of the soil. Pests and diseases happily make themselves a 
                                permanent home as their preferred food source is guaranteed.
                                Crop rotation helps return nutrients to the soil without synthetic inputs.
                                The practice also works to interrupt pest and disease cycles,increase biodiversity on the farm.

                                Cover crops are different from cash crops, which are those that a farmer sells for profit, such as corn or soybeans.
                                Cover crops’ primary job is to improve the soil. They get planted in fields that would otherwise be bare—in between growing seasons, for example—to protect the soil from erosion and nutrient loss.
                                Cover crops also help smother weeds, control pests and diseases, enhance water availability, and increase biodiversity on the farm. Conventional farmers rely on synthetic fertilizers and chemical 
                                herbicides to return nutrients to their soils and fight weeds. Cover crops come to rescue.

                                Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in proximity. The most common goal of intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources that would otherwise not be utilized by a single crop.
                                The major benefits of intercropping are:
                                <ul>
                                <li> Added nutrients for the main crop </li>

                                Vermicomposting is a natural process whereby earthworms convert waste material with rigid structures into compost.
                                Vermicompost is a nutrient-rich fertilizer as well as a soil conditioner. It has been shown to increase plant growth and yield as well as suppressing key pests and diseases of horticultural plants in the greenhouse and in field soils. 
                                Vermicompost is generally of finer structure, contains more plant available nutrients, has higher microbial activity, and possesses better plant growth promoting properties than conventionally produced thermophilic compost.

                                Together these components can create long-lasting sustainable farming practices which can provide

                                Rotational grazing is the practice of containing and moving animals through pasture to improve soil, plant, and animal health.
                                Left alone on a patch of land, animals like cattle and hogs can quickly destroy all signs of life, compacting the soil as they go. However, 
                                if the animals are managed with rotational grazing, the soil sees big returns. Grazing encourages plants to send out more and deeper roots. 
                                Those roots are continually sloughed off to decompose in the ground, boosting soil biomass and fertility and sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. 
                                Rotational grazing also helps prevent erosion and agriculture runoff.
